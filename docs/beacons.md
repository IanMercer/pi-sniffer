# Beacons for Training

The system works with any iBeacon. There are some you can get easily from local stores like Home Depot, e.g. the [DEWALT-TAG](https://amzn.to/34a2Afl) is one
good option (good signal strength, waterproof, appears to have a good signal, does not have replaceable batteries) or the [Milwaukee Tick](https://amzn.to/347fhr9)
is another (replaceable battery, lower cost). There are also longer range and AA battery powered beacons like the AprilBeacon.

Another great option for asset tracking is a [USB iBeacon](https://amzn.to/35feYd2). If you have a spare USB socket on your equipment you can plug one of
these in and then track it as an asset or use it for training.

# iPhone as an iBeacon

For training you can also use an iPhone. Install the [nrfConnect App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect/id1054362403) app, on the Advertiser tab
create an advertiser for each room you will train. For each add the "Indoor Positioning" service. During training leave the iPhone stationary in the space
for about five minutes then turn on the advertiser and leave it for another five minutes. Note the times so you can check the recordings to make sure
you don't accidentally copy patch data from the wrong room / time.
